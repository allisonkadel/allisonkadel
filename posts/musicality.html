              Building a React-Redux App for Music Composition
              </h3>
              <p> 
              
              Because my current version of a music composition management system is some recordings on my cell phone here, some lyrics written in a journal there, and chord progressions jotted in the margins of that book I lost, I decided to create something that would help me record and access everything in one place.
              
              <br><br>
              
               After completing the first feature set and submitting it as a Flatiron School project, I'd like to walk you through how I built this thing and what I see for its future.
                  
              <br><br>
                  
              I started with the backend - the task of setting up a Rails API that my frontend could request data from to render to the browser. Creating the database and model relationships was a helpful excercise in translating the concept of song and lyric creation to 1s and 0s. The basic structure is: there are two models, a <strong>lyric</strong> and a <strong>song</strong>. A song has_many lyrics, and a lyric has_many songs.
              
              <br><br>
                 
               <code>
                   # /models/song.rb <br><br>
                   
                   class Song < ApplicationRecord <br>
                   has_many :lyrics, dependent: :destroy <br>
                   validates :name, :artist, :chords, :presence => :true <br>
                   end

               </code>
                  
               <br><br>
                  
               <code>
                  # /models/lyric.rb <br><br>
                  class Lyric < ApplicationRecord <br>
                  belongs_to :song <br>
                  validates :text, :chord, :presence => :true <br>
                  end
                   
                  </code>
                  
                   
               <br><br>
                   
                   
                Next I built some CRUD actions for my lyrics and songs controllers and configured the routes that I want to client side to have access to. I left the API as a simple implementation so I could focus on integrating some newly earned knowledge: React and Redux!
                  
                   
                <br><br>
                   
                When I first dove in to this javascript package, I was overwhelmed by React's unfamiliar modular style of structuring render data and confused by how it interacts with Redux and what functionality that provides us with. After much learning, here is what I've ascertained:
                   
                <br><br>
                   
                The modular style of React, specifically the structure of building a series of components and containers, that will interact to display data, became very intuitive and made easier seeing the parallels between backend and frontend data.
              
                <br><br>
                   
                Redux is used to manage the entirety of the state in your application via a javascript object called <code>store</code>, which individual components can subscribe to via the <code>connect()</code> function and assign certain state values to designated component props.
                   
                 <br><br>
                   
                   It is also through <code>connect()</code> that our components can access our action creators that will dispatch actions and change the state of our store.
                   
                <br><br>
                  
                  The basic beauty of Redux is that it provides a central location for us to manage our state, and does so in a consistent, immutable and communicative fashion.
                  
                 <br><br>
                  
                  Here's a visual representation of how Redux flows:
                  
                  <br><br>
                  
                  <img src="../img/redux-flow.png"></img>
                  
                  <br><br>
             
                    To begin with the frontend, I decided how I would structure the component tree. I built a <strong>container</strong> component (a component that talks to the <code>store</code>) for each of the lyric and song models. These components would be responsible for subscribing to the store to allow for state to be update and actions to be dispatched.
             
                   <br><br>
                    <code>
                   &lt;App /&gt; <br>
                   ---&lt;SongsContainer /> <br>
                   ------&lt;SongForm /> <br>
                   ------&lt;Songs /> <br>
                   ---------&lt;SongCard /> <br>
                   ---&lt;LyricsContainer/> <br>
                   ------&lt;LyricForm /> <br>                        
                   ------&lt;Lyrics /> <br>
                   ---------&lt;LyricCard />

                   
                    </code>
                    <br><br>
             
                    As mentioned, <strong>lyrics</strong> and <strong>songs</strong> each have a container to house their related components. Each of these containers connect to the store and then pass down some props to their sub-components. The Songs and SongCard as well as Lyrics and LyricCard are <strong>presentational</strong> components (responsible primarily for displaying data) that are passed important data via props. The Form components are a hybrid between container and presentational, as they subscribe to the <code>store</code> in order to keep form fields up to date as well as display the form itself.
             
                    <br><br>
             
             I built <strong>action creator</strong> functions that would be responsible for dispatching actions, and reducers that would be responsible for receiving these actions and updating the store. Here is how a new song will be added to the store:
             
                    <br><br>
             
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                        # /actions/songs.js
                        
                        const addSong = song => {
                            return {
                                type: 'CREATE_SONG_SUCCESS',
                                song
                            }
                         }
                    </code>
                    </pre>
        
                    This action creator, when called, will be dispatched to the corresponding <strong>reducer</strong>:
                    <br><br>
             
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                    export default (state = [], action) => {
                        switch(action.type) {

                            case 'GET_SONGS_SUCCESS':
                                return action.songs

                            case 'CREATE_SONG_SUCCESS':
                                return state.concat(action.song) // Here's how to reducer changes the store's state!!!
            
                        case 'DELETE_SONG':
                            return state.filter(song => action.id !== song.id)
       
            
                        default:
                            return state;
                        }
                    }
                    </code>
                    </pre>
             
                    In the event that we need to make a request to our backend to get or post some data, we can use a package called <a href="">Thunk</a> that will allow us to make an asynchronous <code>fetch()</code> request to our API and upon completion <code>dispatch()</code> an action that is a function, not just a plain object. And what is this action? Our action creator we previously created!
             <br><br>
             
             <br><br>
             
             <pre>
             <code>
             export const createSong = song => {
                return dispatch => {
                    dispatch(postRequest())
                    return fetch('http://192.168.1.31:3000/api/v1/songs', {
                        method: 'POST',
                        headers: {
                            "Content-Type": "application/json"
                        },
                        body: JSON.stringify({song: song})
                    })
                    .then(response => response.json())
                    .then(song => {
                        dispatch(addSong(song)) // Action Creator function from before!!!
                            dispatch(resetSongForm())
                    })
                    .catch(error => console.log(error))
                }
            }
             </code>
             </pre>
             
                  This question is about <strong>event order</strong>. There are a few models that describe this order once an event is registered and the way it can be described is in terms of event propagation direction, or in other words if subsequent events will be registered from innermost to outermost element or from outermost to inner. When <strong>event capturing</strong> is used, our outer rectangle event will be registered first, followed by our nested rectangle. When <strong>event bubbling</strong> is used, the propagation moves in the opposite direction.
               <br><br>
               Certain browsers default to certain models, but we may have different reasons for using one or the other. <strong>Event delegation </strong>is the method of using event bubbling to attach event handlers to outer elements of the target element. This comes in handy when the event we would like to attach an event handler to does not yet exist. We will dive into this scenario in a later post.
                <br><br>                   
                Until then, may your events be handled, ordered, propagated and delegated with joy!
